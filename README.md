# Quantum Gate Tutorials 
Quantum Gate Tutorials provides an open source library for playing with quantum gates and creating quantum circuits from these gates. The user is provided the opportunity to play with and create qubits by creating their vector and matrix equivalents in Mathematica. This gives the user the opportunity to explore the mathematics behind quantum computing and the underlying logic behind Quantum gates.

# Usage
To get started, download the "QuantumGates_SingleQubit.nb" to get an introduction on how to manipulate a single qubit. It is also recommended that you download and play with the "DiracNotation.nb" file as well to get an understanding of how qubits are written and described Mathematically.

# Using this library 
The library provides a sequence of Mathematica files that walks you through how to manipulate qubits and quantum gates step by step. To do this, each of the listed files goes over the topic described in the filename by giving detailed examples. From there, the user is encouraged to use the existing qubits and quantum gates within the file to create their own quantum computations. At the end of the Tutorial set, the user should be familiar with how to manipulate qubits at a basic level.
